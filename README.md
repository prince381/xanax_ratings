This [Github](https://github.com/prince381/xanax_ratings) repository contains the files and other resources for my 
project which entails training a machine learning model in python to predict the rating of Xanax drug based on the comment/review of the
user. All the code associated with this project is written in python programming language and contained in two files. One being a jupyter
notebook (Xanax_rating_prediction.ipynb) in which the data is analysed and the machine learning model is beign trained, and the other
beign a python script (xanax_reviews_scraping.py).
