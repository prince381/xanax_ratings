# XANAX USER REVIEWS DATA ANALYSIS 
This [Github](https://github.com/prince381/xanax_ratings) repository contains the files and other resources for my data science
project which entails crawling the web for data on Xanas drug user reviews, and analyzing the data. All the code associated with this project is written in python programming
language and contained in two files. One being a jupyter notebook (Xanax_data_analysis.ipynb) in which the data is analysed, and the other beign a python script (xanax_reviews_scraping.py) which contains the code for
scraping the data from [drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/comments/alprazolam/xanax.html).

Xanax (alprazolam) is an anti-anxiety medication in the benzodiazepine family, the same family that includes diazepam (Valium), clonazepam
(Klonopin), lorazepam (Ativan), flurazepam (Dalmane), and others. Xanax works by decreasing abnormal excitement in the brain and was
approved by the FDA in October 1981. Benzodiazepines act on the brain and central nervous system to produce a calming effect.
Xanax slows down the movement of brain chemicals that may have become unbalanced, resulting in a reduction in nervous tension and anxiety.
Xanax works by boosting the effects of a natural chemical made in the brain called gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).
