# XANAX USER RATINGS PREDICTION
This [Github](https://github.com/prince381/xanax_ratings) repository contains the files and other resources for my 
project which entails training a machine learning model in python to predict the rating of Xanax drug based on the comment/review of the
user. All the code associated with this project is written in python programming language and contained in two files. One being a jupyter
notebook (Xanax_rating_prediction.ipynb) in which the data is analysed and the machine learning model is beign trained, and the other
beign a python script (xanax_reviews_scraping.py).

Xanax (alprazolam) is an anti-anxiety medication in the benzodiazepine family, the same family that includes diazepam (Valium), clonazepam
(Klonopin), lorazepam (Ativan), flurazepam (Dalmane), and others. Xanax works by decreasing abnormal excitement in the brain and was
approved by the FDA in October 1981. Benzodiazepines act on the brain and central nervous system to produce a calming effect.
Xanax slows down the movement of brain chemicals that may have become unbalanced, resulting in a reduction in nervous tension and anxiety.
Xanax works by boosting the effects of a natural chemical made in the brain called gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).
