"February 1, 2020",Anxiety,"I've taken xanax to help me sleep for several years. I try to take it as little as possible so I won't get addicted. It makes me tired, even at.25 so I don't take it during the day. Luckily, I don't suffer from panic attacks very often.  I probably take it a few times a month just before bed. It works better than it antihistamines although I frequently wake up after 6 hours which is all it seems to last. I have heard about it leading to Alzheimer's though. I'm afraid of that.",9.0
"January 22, 2020",Anxiety,"I have been on Xanax for about 20 years, 1mg for sleep. I am not addicted to it but dependent like a person with high blood pressure is dependent on meds., or diabetic dependent on insulin, or humans dependent on oxygen.   I have had no side reactions and am 78 years old.  It has saved my life.  Try not sleeping for a week and see what happens. You will be inside your worse nightmare Why the uproar over physical dependence, I do not know.  It must come from the Gov.",10
"January 19, 2020",Anxiety,"I have been using this drug for several years for my anxiety attacks, and it great. But anxiety has been getting worse and worse especially during work which causes heart stress (thanks so much anxiety..), so my doctor is now letting me take it during my 5-day work week. It works excellently. I am so much more calm and present at work. I will say I am a lot more lethargic, and that is noticeable. But otherwise I have no side effects, so I will continue with this treatment and I am so glad that it is so effective. The good outweighs the bad for me, but I will say that if you tend to be more dependent on drugs like these, I don’t recommend it for you. I have no addiction to it and no withdrawal symptoms when go days without after taking it for multiple days in a row. So just be aware, and pay attention to your body. If you are struggling with learning the difference between wanting another dose and needing another dose, talk to your doctor.",10
"January 14, 2020",Anxiety,I have been taking xanax for  10 years. Through an alcohol addiction I drink while on  Xanax not a good idea If used as prescribed  It takes away my panic attacks. I couldn't even leave the house without.  It also helped me stop drinking 3 years sober now still on xanax 1 mg 3 times daily. Some days now I don't even take it . With proper self control it saved my life. Hands down. I  had a lot of stress since quitting drinking between family members dying. This last year has been   hard to say the least 2019 was probably the worst year of my life and I stayed sober through It. No more alcohol,10
"January 12, 2020",Depression,I’m sorry my Dr ever put me on Xanax.  It’s a EVIL drug . If your dr puts you on it more than a few weeks your will have a Xanax addiction . It’s not safe . Read up on  Xanax. This will be my third relapse it’s not in your mind I almost died twice trying to get off of Xanax my heart stopped 6 times and 5 seizures . Other Benzos are safer . The Drs are at fault not the company Pfizer has a warning no more than  two weeks on Xanax.,1.0
"January 9, 2020",Panic Disorder,"Xanax has a paradoxical effect on me. Makes me have panic attacks like I had never experienced before. So many doctors have told me how safe it is, and it wasn’t until I was almost committed for attempted suicide that my doctor admitted that it may not be for me! For some reason doctors are really in love with Xanax and it is hard to get them to listen to patients criticisms.",1.0
"January 6, 2020",Panic Disorder,"This drug  Xanax does exactly what it’s supposed to do for panic attacks. It’s honestly the only prescribed drug I’ve ever taken that really fulfils what it says it will do. I’ve been taking this medicine for close to 20 years sometimes not for long periods of time but very steadily for about the past 7. I gave it nine stars bc it is super effective but has a good deal of drawbacks. For one, it’s crazy addicting. I feel I’m definitely addicted to it and start having very serious withdrawals if I skip a few days. Personally, I feel like it’s the lesser of two bad options being that not having it my life is just constant anxiety and panic but it creates its own anxiety knowing that you need it. I currently take 2 mg a day and sometimes I break it up throughout the day. If your anxiety is truly severe and strongly affecting your life I would recommend taking it but if that’s not the case I would use some discretion before getting involved with a drug as strong as this.",9.0
"January 6, 2020",Anxiety,Suffered major depression and anxiety when my father died when I was 18 years of age. I constantly considered killing my self. Antidepressants and therapy had little effect on my outlook on life. But then I was prescribed Xanax. I learned to calm down and to actually take a look at my life. Just don’t abuse the drug and it works wonders.,10
"January 4, 2020",Anxiety,"Well, I have mixed thoughts about Xanax. On one hand, it is a very fast acting drug, and seems to be more ""powerful"" than klonopin at the same dosage (0.5mg). On the other hand, it seems to have a very short time effect, with a more pronounced ""knock out"" effect. In short: at least for me klonopin works much better. 
I stopped cold turkey (not the right thing to do, I know) and had no issues at all. I had taken it for over a year for panic. 
Also, it seemed to boost my appetite beyond normal levels, but I leave this as an open question as to a plausible effect.",6.0
"December 30, 2019",Anxiety,"I have been having sleep issues for years.  At times its not too bad but lately it's been hard to fall a asleep. I also get up multiple times to urinate due to an enlarged prostate.  I'm 51.  

My wife had some Xanax and she told me to try one before going to bed.  I used it the last 2 nights.  The pills are 0.5 mg.

OMG, I slept like a BABY for the 2 nights and felt so refreshed.  I also only got up once to use the bathroom.   Most nights I get up almost every hour to urinate.  That wreaks my sleep.

I will not take the pill every night but I may periodically.

Too bad it's not safe to take for a long period of time.",10
"December 15, 2019",Anxiety,"Was prescribed Xanax .25 mg as needed about 9 months ago. After a few weeks I cut it back on my own to .125 as needed. I’m averaging .1 mg a day. I’m concerned about long term use,  ( is 9 months considered long term?) Withdrawal is another fear( does replacing Xanax with another drug make any sense?)  and mostly, the dizziness that I feel almost daily, especially when standing up or getting out of bed. Anyone have advice or personal experience that can help me? I’m 62, with 3 widow maker stents, but otherwise in excellent health.",7.0
"December 9, 2019",Panic Disorder,"Xanax really helps me with my panic attacks. If normally a panic attack would last me around 3-4 hours, if I take this it will be gone in around 30 minutes and then feel extremely calm and peaceful. It really helps a lot and I don't think I'll ever stop taking it, because I  just can't deal with my panic attacks on my own.",10
"December 7, 2019",Anxiety,"I have panic disorder, anxiety, some OCD.  I’ve been on Xanax (1mg as needed which ends up being daily but usually only at night and then I take 2) for about 7 years.  I was originally prescribed it more than 20 years ago but kept it as a security blanket.  I’ll never forget the first time I actually got the nerve to try it.  “This is what normal people feel like???”, was my response.  I would keep my review at a 10 EXCEPT, now I’m hearing LOTS of talk (and medical reviews) that it causes dementia/Alzheimer’s!!!  This is the ONLY drug that works for me and I feel I need to get off of it.  Scared and torn and would love a solution.",10
"December 3, 2019",Anxiety,Xanax takes away all the nervousness mind racing and anxiety while making me feel calm and content. Miracle drug to me,10
"November 23, 2019",Anxiety,I was prescribed 2mg Xanax 2 times a day for severe anxiety and insomnia this drug works amazing for sleeping issues as far as anxiety I just break a piece off and let it dissolve under my tongue (nasty taste) but takes anxiety away immediately. I'm so glad my psychiatrist put me on this medication for anxiety /panic attacks/insomnia I don't abuse it sometimes I even go days without having to even take it .... Its definitely a life saver to have though!!,10
"November 19, 2019",Anxiety,"I have severe OCD, with accompanying anxiety and debilitating insomnia.  Xanax helps me break thought loops.  I only take it a few times per week, almost exclusively at night, and rarely during the day when I'm hit with a paralyzing bout of obsessional thought.  I take  .125 mg (half a .25mg pill).  Surprisingly, that is enough to stop the ruminating and make me a little drowsy, and that adds up to falling asleep.  Sometimes I take it in the middle of the night to get back to sleep, but only if I don't have to get up early the next day and if I didn't take it to get to sleep that night in the first place.  The way I see it, if .125 to .25 mg stops working for me, it'll be time to move on and maybe revisit Xanax at a later date.  Having tried a great many different medications, I'm beginning to think rotating treatments is the way to go anyway, to prevent tolerance, addiction, and avoid long-term side effects/consequences.",9.0
"November 17, 2019",Anxiety,"l suffer panic and distress. doctor wrote  a prescription 0.25mg Xanax twice per day for me,  three weeks pasted. l feel very good.",10
"November 15, 2019",Anxiety,"I have awful, crippling anxiety that sometimes makes me spiral into holes of despair and this helps me out of them but my body just feels so weird I am not sure it's worth it sometimes TBH. My body (esp. my arms) feel really heavy...? I'm only on 0.5 mg and take it only in emergencies.",7.0

"November 12, 2019",Depression,"I started taking Xanax to cure my depression, but all it's done is make it worse. I've been taking 5mg a day for the past 12 years and I can't stop. someone please help. I have a problem.",10
"November 12, 2019",Anxiety,"Xanax saved me from having anxiety and panic attacks I just take one 2MG once a day,  it says to take it twice a day but I don't..just once 2MG a day",NaN
"November 9, 2019",Anxiety,"The first time my doctor gave me xanax I thought this is the best! I started with 1mg per day, then 2, and then 3. It made me feel so calm and more happy.
But I realized after how addictive it is. Now I take Xanax up to 6mg per day because I feel is the only thing that helps me not having anxiety and panic attacks. Sometimes I just enjoy how it makes me feel.
It has been very effective but I also think is dangerous.
Because I don't care about the side effects but I am very scared of the thought of overdosing. I lie to people about how mg I take in a day. 
Take care of your self, if you have depression. It is easily to get addicted because it gives you that empty feeling you might find pleasant.",8.0
"November 8, 2019",Panic Disorder,"I was prescribed 0.5mg Xanax as needed for my PTSD, severe anxiety and panic attacks. I can say it works 100% . My panic attacks lasted about 45mins before it was prescribed and now they last about 5mins. I take about 1mg (2 doses of 0.5mg) when I feel it coming on. This drug saved my life! I am also on 150mg of Zoloft, and hydroxizine for the evening to keep my anxiety down and help me sleep. They say this drug is very very addictive but my Psychiatrist said it’s hard to get addicted if you use it correctly and only as needed. Make sure to not drink much with Xanax or it will make you sleep for a long time and super dangerous. I will be on this med for a very very long time.",10
"November 7, 2019",Anxiety,"Been on Xanax for almost 17 years for acute anxiety disorder. I also have a rare heart condition that I take meds for. Xanax was good at first but now after 17 years and up to a prescription of 6mg a day. Just came down from 8mg a day. It’s messing with me. In the past few months I’ve been experiencing what I call googly eyes followed by a headache. I’ve told my Drs and none have an explanation. So I did a test myself. Took my heart meds as usual in the morning left out the Xanax. No googly eyes. Until I took one then there it was. Dizzy ,couldn’t see straight had to lay down with a bad headache. Can you build up a bad dose in your body after taking so much for so long? I’ve only been on the 8&6 mg for about 5 years. I have a family and I know I’m going to need in patient care to get off this stupid medicine. Also let me add yes I know I’m addicted and dependent but I’m scared and not sure if what to do but try to slowly ween myself off. Of course my dr is helping.",10
"November 6, 2019",Panic Disorder,Xanax cured my drinking/Heavy drug problem..  5 months clean now and I have no feeling or urge to relapse back. Thank you.,10
"November 1, 2019",Panic Disorder,"Xanax is amazing, stops a severe panic attack very quickly. I go from absolute terror to calm and relaxed within 10 minutes after taking Xanax.",10
"November 1, 2019",Panic Disorder,"I take Xanax now and again for severe anxiety when I feel a panic attack is coming on. It works wonders and is a godsend. I am sensitive to meds so even 1.5 mg is enough for me to take. I wouldn't be taking this everyday for anxiety because you get used to it & then it won't work, so then you end up upping the dose and quantity which you'll end up addicted. It's only for short term use. I never take it after a panic attack cos it's already happened so that's pointless, unless I'm still crippled with anxiety or the panic doesn't stop. Now that I know it helps and it's there I get less panicky now because I know a xanax can stop it. I think that's a psychological thing for me. But it's amazing how it works. I could be totally panicky, nauseated, chronically worrying and just take one of these and 15 mins later I couldn't care less if the house fell down. Get the best nights sleep too.",10
"October 28, 2019",Depression,the only real issue I have with this med is the feeling of having something to always be depending on and never really feeling in control.,5.0
"October 27, 2019",Depression,Amazing drug. People say it’s bad but they lie about it all the time in the news Bottom line for me  it’s a safe drug. But like all things even video games it can be addictive. Just use it responsibly. In other words don't  take too regularly.,10

"September 24, 2019",Anxiety,"I rated Xanax a 5 because yes at first it was a god send! I got an appetite became interested in daily activities again, gave me motivation and I once again had goals set for myself. However this drug is for short term use and that's it! I was on it for several years and when I became physically dependent on it what was prescribed to me was never enough! I not only was physically dependent but also addicted! It began to cause increased anxiety, irrational behavior, destructive actions, and really bad mood swings! I weaned myself off as soon as I realized it was causing the problems in my life! If you get on this medication don't stay on it for too long! Getting off of this medication was the hardest thing I have ever done in my whole life I am still struggling with it 2 years later!",5.0
"September 24, 2019",Anxiety,"I've been on Xanax for 25 years. Same 2 mg dose the entire time. It got added to my meds due to Childhood PTSD that would not allow me to calm down and sleep. This drug should not be used alone. Other meds should be in place. If you take this drug and need to continue increase the dosage amount, this drug may not be for you. You need a diagnosis from a psychiatrist to even get this drug. You will be monitored for a long time while on it. Monthly visits to the doctor for years and years. Once you can prove that you can take this medication responsibly you may find the ""rules"" relaxed a bit. You are not to drink on this drug. I have rarely had a drink for the last 25 years. A cocktail once in a blue moon.",10
"September 22, 2019",Anxiety,"I have had anxiety for many years. About 30. Not until 37 years old did it crush me. I started with Zoloft and buspurone. Then came the Xanax. 
The first day I took one I felt like I have missed my life all these years. I looked at my wife and said the following. 
“Have I been an A-hole for the last 13 years?”

She said yes. 

“You must really love me”

She said yes again. 

For the first time in my life I realized how much anxiety took over my life. I can literally feel the difference of me being that angry anxiety filled person. 
Now, I take .5 every 2 days. I actually enjoy life. Before it was just there. Like a clouded mind just floating there. Not feeling or computing. When I take a Xanax, I feel alive. Happy. I look at my kids and I can actually enjoy them and literally feel the abundance of love I have for they. And that makes life so much better to live.",10
"September 19, 2019",Anxiety,"I did get terrible withdrawal when I tapered off xanax last year.  Now panic almost everyday.  Will ask for valium instead of xanax, cuz longer half-life means less withdrawal.  I'm so tired of being obsessive & terrified without meds, and sleepy with meds.",7.0
"September 19, 2019",Anxiety,"I have no problem taking Xanax for sleep  for years.. 

I  am now  trying to get off of it - only in the fear that they won't be manufacturing it  for long, and doctors are  so reluctant to  prescribe it.   I'm scared I will have withdrawal effects.. .. so I have to do it very slow..  But  I truly   have no complaints taking    1 mg.. or  half  for sleep at night and for anxiety.

Now because of silly adolescents and adults trying to get high I am unable to get Xanax - the only medication that has kept me sane for 30years. I only filled my prescription 3-4x a year.
I never got high from taking it. I didn't know you could.  
I barely leave the house now and I have panic attacks while driving and this is new to me ...panic attacks wake me up. I can't even sleep on peace. I'm in AZ where pot is legal but Xanax is not. No one prescribes it anymore. The stupid Dr's here think panic attacks are not real and laugh at me. They see my child. She is always with me.",10

Was able to lead a high-functioning life and hold down a 20-year high functioning career with the state. After this many years and all the reading that I have done and also my experience in working with psychiatric patients I understand what a benzodiazepine can do in my estimation it is The Most Dangerous Drug bar none to detox from. Because of the opiate epidemic it is being suggested to the medical community to also curtail use of benzodiazepines. If I came away with nothing from this post I hope to come away with the fact that doctors need to be educated as to the dangers removing patients from long-term benzodiazepine use without titrating,10
"August 29, 2019",Panic Disorder,"Well I've been taking Xanax for more than 22 years now for panic disorder. I'm literally addicted to Xanax. 
Doctor told me my panic disorder would last 6 months only, but turned out it lasted for years. Doctor didn't inform me about the addictive nature of Xanax. Only in 2007 after much research I found out that all my  mental disorders are caused by lack of nutrients. Started taking nutrients supplements. It worked but unfortunately I had to stick to Xanax for quite a while until I can find a way to quit it altogether. Though Xanax is useful in treating anxiety and panic disorder, unfortunately it is a terrible and addictive drug. I urge you all to take nutrients supplements and try tapering on Xanax. It will work.

I spent all day at home watching TV and listening to music. I had no desire to deal with people or any type of social interaction. I found myself avoiding everything like going grocery shopping, driving, dealing with problems. Every time I tried getting off the Xanax it would backfire.

The days I am using this medication are 100x more productive and filled with joy...I'm sick of seeing only negative propaganda about Xanax. If you are a responsible adult who uses it properly, it is not harmful. If you use a heart medication each day, and it keeps you healthy, are you ""addicted"" to that? It's the same with anxiety. Mental health is just as serious as the physical. Just because some are abusing it, doesn't mean judge those who use it correctly. I appreciate everything this med has done for me!",10
"July 30, 2019",Anxiety,It’s a rip off and I never will I ask for this again. It’s a disgusting drunk feeling you get from this but it does calm you down and make you tired so that’s why I gave it the stars. Anyone with anxiety use Ativan it’s so much cleaner and makes me feel completely normal. Strange how similar these drugs are but how different they effect me,6.0
"July 29, 2019",Anxiety,I’d had taken Ativan prior to this and my experience wasn’t that great with Xanax it made me feel really sedated and gave a drunk feeling and hangover the next day on only .5 kind of made me paranioid a little bit. I would highly recommend Ativan over Xanax as Ativan gives you a calm feeling better for anxiety at least for me and not that disgusting drunk feeling,7.0
"July 26, 2019",Anxiety,"I started with Xanax  for anxiety 30 years ago and have gradually increased. I used to take perhaps 0.25mg occasionally when I started, and now 30 years later, at age 71, I am up to three 0.5mg a day. I successfully fight to not take it more often and I almost always win the fight. When I don't, I take an extra 0.25mg or 0.5mg. Meanwhile without it I would not have had a successful college teaching career , traveled to Europe 28 times, produced a cable TV show, written 3 books, had hundreds of friends who love and respect me, and even worked out at the gym where I swim, walk, and work out with weights regularly. My current psychiatrist tells me frequently (I ask him every few months because I read terrible things) that I should not be concerned, that I am using it intelligently, and it helps me live a great and fantastic life filled with success, satisfaction, love and affection of so many people. My anxiety could be debilitating, but here I am living a great life.",10
"July 26, 2019",Anxiety,So I took Xanax at the hospital for my anxiety I had it for at least two days before going in and it didn’t seem to really work it would make me go to bed for about 5-10 minutes and if wake up from anxiety again I would get no sleep and if I did I’d wake up with anxiety again so I don’t know if there’s something wrong with me but I didn’t feel better at all after I took a Xanax,1.0
"July 25, 2019",Anxiety,"It’s really hard to rate this medication because there are two sides to it, short term and long term. Short term ( 20 minutes- 4 hours) it can feel like a life saver. It will calm you down, and if needed let the pill dissolve under your tongue (sublingually) for faster results. I. This case it gets a 10/10. You should not take this medication long term (3 months max) or overuse Xanax or any benzodiazepine. You will become dependent, you will become tolerated and getting off of this medication usually requires a medical detox because of the potential of death, definitely extreme discomfort and anxiety levels off the charts. It gets a 0/10 on that side. Taking too much or drinking on Xanax is potentially fatal . Also taking it long term effects both long and short term memory severely. I recommend you take this review seriously as I have been through all of this minus death and I don’t wish my experience on anybody.",6.0
"July 24, 2019",Anxiety,"I suppose ONE reason why Xanax is so addictive is because it works, and it always reliably will. (There's also a ""high"" that you get at the higher doses, but it quickly fades with ongoing use.) 
A significant problem with Xanax and all others benzos is the amotivational symptoms that results from chronic use. It certainly becomes increasingly hard to perform basic tasks, as one feels TOO relaxed to get anything done. 
Even more serious of a problem with Xanax in particular is its rebound effects that make the symptoms WORSE than before. Because Xanax is so powerful but short-acting, within just a couple, or maybe a few, hours of taking it, one feels the URGENT, overwhelming need to take more. It can quickly form dependence. It also makes it difficult to sleep because you rebound in the middle of the night.",8.0

Not only did it help me sleep and stop my restless legs at night, it helped with constant severe anxiety AND it helped my depression, too.  I've been taking Xanax for 15 years.  I've never taken more than the prescribed amount, because I know it can be addictive AND I know that I won't be able to get it if I abuse it.  Frankly, it doesn't make me groggy, high, or anything other than ""normal.""  It feels really great to just feel normal, and that is why it frightens and frustrates me when I have to change prescribers (of all my meds) and some object to the

I’m so shy about taking it as you should use caution and use it when you feel it’ll help detour a panic attack. Then currently I started getting gallstones and they cause nausea.

For 2 months I have tried Lexapro now and I feel like it is just making things worse, but when I take a 0.25 Xanax I feel a lot better and the anxiety and constant worry, butterflies in stomach, dreadful feeling about life dissipates. The cloud over me lifts and I can actually feel positive emotions again. They say the benefits of Xanax only last a few hours which is why they can be so addictive, but I feel relief for about 24 hours on the smallest dose.

This medication keeps me on an even keel and stops the occasional panic attack in its track within 30 minutes.  My doctor periodically reviews my need VS addictive tendencies of this medication.

"May 18, 2019",Anxiety,"Many have said that alprazolam is a life-saver.  I endorse that statement fully.  If you panic or become anxious you'll be unable to process thoughts properly which affects ALL your decisions, from making coffee in the morning to DRIVING your car to fulfilling your employment.

Also, highly endorse taking the 0.5 mg before bed.   Wake refreshed by the benefit of uninterrupted sleep.

Thirdly, I read from someone up above my post, and I've experienced this awful phenomenon too, so => DON'T share what prescriptions you take with anyone that is not a health professional.  You'll leave yourself open to criticism that is detrimental to you by non-doctors !  

Xanax is an important, very helpful, prescription.  I'm sorry that some have the ""addiction gene"" (my terminology, not official).  They should definitely 'watch it' if they know themselves to have an addictive nature. I believe the 'script can still help them.  Sometimes I go for a few days without needing it and notice no withdrawal.

However, you must be careful because this medication is a benzodiazepine & it can be super addicting. Therefore, I personally only take it when I absolutely need it, mostly to sleep. This medication relaxes me, which makes me happy & especially hungry. It really takes the anxiety right out of your stomach if that's where you hold it. I do notice since I've started on birth control it effects me differently, not bad just different.",NaN

I have yet to find another person to whom this didn't work either. Overall I don't think this is worth the risk and even if you do take it, it only helps for a short period of time.

I couldn't leave the house it was debilitating.  I was put on Prozac and told to take Xanax as needed only. So I started on 0.5 when I really really needed it. In the beginning I will say I took one about every week. Then Prozac kicked in and I was fine. I still get those moments where I can feel the panic attack coming, so I will pop one and I'm good to go. One bottle of 30 pills could last me years! But because they expire after 2 years, the doctor sends me for a fresh bottle. If taken responsibly,  this medication is great. No side effects for me and 0.5 mg is more than enough to take the edge off.

"March 25, 2019",Anxiety,"I would rate this drug a 10/10 if it wasn't for the fast tolerance that you develop the more frequently you take it, and the very high risk of dependency, because it really works like magic and I felt no side effects. I tried my best to be careful while taking this, and although I definitely developed tolerance as I feel the lower dose (0.25 mg) does nothing for me, thankfully I didn't become dependent on it because I tried to minimize usage as much as possible. I would say Xanax can be like magic when you feel like you're going through debilitating anxiety and have frequent panic attacks, but it is a quick fix and should be used as a short-term treatment while finding a long-term treatment, because I can see how physical and psychological dependency can easily develop - if the issue isn't addressed and use is frequently continued.

I FINALLY took one when I was so desperate I didn’t have any other choice. I take 0.5 most days.  People take all kinds of medication for all kinds of other diseases. Anxiety and depression are a disease just the same as anything else.  It’s a shame that we are made to feel like we’re doing something wrong for using Xanax.   It has helped me control my anxiety and depression for about 8 years now. Without it I honestly don’t know what would have happened to me by now. It stops the terrible cycle of impending doom. It has kept me from going in to major anxiety and depression so many times I can’t count.  Mental problems are the hardest thing I’ve EVER dealt with in my life.

Over time, the feeling seemed to subside, until it came back with vengeance at a job interview during college. My gyno was the first to prescribe me Xanax after I was diagnosed with pelvic muscle spasms. I didn’t take it until that feeling crept up on me one night. Xanax made it subside almost immediately. It was then I realized I had been suffering with anxiety/panic all this time. I now take Xanax on occasion when my panic comes back, but even just knowing what this feeling is now has helped so much.

"October 9, 2018",Anxiety,"From my experience with Xanax it ruins lives, period. Xanax was made for 14 day use for acute crisis but is grossly misprescribed. Xanax is more addictive than heroin and turns normal people into weird and angry shells of who they previously were.
The drug causes the brain to stop producing chemicals it needs and the half life is so short that you go into withdrawal every time the drug “runs out” every 4 hours. You believes the feeling is “anxiety” and take another pill to treat it! However the feeling is just withdrawal. You will need more and more of the drug just to get the original effects and you will not really be aware of how you’re acting. The longer you take the drug the worse it gets- and eventually the doctor who got you hooked on it will stop prescribing it.
A safe way to get off of Xanax is the Ashton method  (Benzodiazepines
How They Work & How to Withdraw)- switching slowly from Xanax to Valium. Valium like a longer acting form of Xanax which then is easier to cut down on. I urge you never to start the drug.",1.0

"October 2, 2018",Anxiety,"I had severe postpartum anxiety to the point of no sleep for 3 months, which made me lose touch with all reality. I couldn’t take benzos as I was determined to breastfeed. Once I got through another bout of insomnia when I stopped breastfeeding I was suicidal from lack of sleep and panic/anxiety. I was put on xanax, .125 to .25 per day before bed. 4 years later I still have anxiety around sleep, so I take half the lowest dose 45 mins before bed. I struggle with sleep at times but I have not increased my dose over the 4 years and don’t freak out or withdraw if I miss a dose. My doctor hired a new nurse  who seems bent on getting me off it, makes me plead my case to get refills. I don’t understand this thinking-a low dose of Xanax forever is better than a strung out suicidal insomniac.  I have tried all SSRIs, hypnosis, counselling, meditation, CBTI for insomnia and hormone therapy. Nothing works as well as half a xanax 45 mins before bed. It’s just reality for me.",9.0

I am 56 years old with tachycardia and have never abused my medications. I sure wish they hadn’t started changing them again with my aging. I suffer anxiety and PTSD which I kept under control, living with a quality of life, enjoying my grandchildren, grocery shopping for myself living alone with my arthritis disability smiling through the pain.

Was so hard for me for almost 3 months after using them everyday for 2 years. Will never take one of them again. They actually just takes away your anxiety while you are on them. Problem is that all of us are using them for a period. Then you get all the anxiety back again and the problem is now it is 5 x worse than what it was to begin with. Stopping my Xanax like I wanted to do the first day - just stop taking them - is dangerous my Doctor said that would not be possible, since I actually could die from it. So instead it is a slow painful reduction of dosage day after day. Just as warning take Valium, or in that range instead it is much less stress when you are quitting them",NaN

When my blood pressure went so high I burst a blood vessel in my eye I finally met a doctor who was an expert in panic disorder.

Taking it once in a while when required is fine but using it every day will give you horrible withdrawals.

"September 14, 2017",Panic Disorder,"I have been on Xanax for 15 years I'm only 30 years old. While this is a miracle drug for pulling you out of a panic attack and preventing them. This medicine works extremely well for my anxiety that said it can cause a very nasty dependence and addiction where you will need larger and larger doses to combat this rebound anxiety (this is what the Dr call it). It's your brain screaming for more of the drug, this is not only a mental dependency but also a very strong physical one. If you are thinking about taking Xanax remember less is more the less you take the better it works. It has become part of my daily meds 2 mg 3 to 4 times a day and that's coming from being on the max dose legally available 10 mg daily you don't want that. Use Caution",8.0

I get thirty .05 a month and I can go days without them and some days a have to take two or three. Anyone with anxiety disorders know some days aren't easy at all. It helps me just knowing I have them. I still currently take celexa daily I don't know if it really helps my anxiety at all but the combo with the xanax seems to work.

"August 19, 2017",Anxiety,"Dad always had some amount of general anxiety but managed it reasonably.  In approx 1982 he was prescribed Xanax after his Dad died unexpectedly and he was instructed to take X as needed.  He's been on and off X ever since then and has needed progressively more.  About 20 years ago he ""graduated"" to other medications including anti-depressants and at one point was on a combo that resulted in a nearly-successful suicide attempt.  He never had suicidal thoughts before or after that particular combo.  He's now old and his life is in ruins.  He takes X throughout the day but is at the max and cannot take more.

I had to keep increasing the dose as my panic and anxiety increased. I ended up becoming agoraphobic. I could not leave my house without taking a handful of Xanax first. In the end, I was taking way , way, way too much enough to kill an elephant. I know it sounds hard to believe. It's amazing I am still alive. I had to beg my insurance company to put me in the hospital to detox. I tried to kill myself. I almost died while in the hospital.

Xanax has helped me against this terrible nervousness, demonic, feeling. I only take it when I truly need it. I take the lowest dose possible 0.25. The thing about this drug is that it makes you feel so relaxed. So people keep taking it, to keep feeling good and that's when it backfires. Please only take it as needed. Don't take it if your not feeling panic at the moment. You have to respect this drug. And taking it when u don't feel panic is not the way to go. Trust me!

Was on ativan for 3 years and it eventually stopped working. Would take 2 0.5mg pills and it would not affect my anxiety at all. Psychiatrist switched me to xanax 0.5mg everyday as needed up to 3 pills a day. It actually works. It takes a few minutes and wipes away any panic attack and softens my anxiety. I am very careful though because I know it can be very addictive. I was clean off the ativan for months and had no withdrawls so I know I was not addicted to that. Have only been on the xanax a few months and I only take it AS NEEDED so not to get addicted.,10

I am taking suboxone for chronic pain issues from a MVA.  I had been on prescription oxycontin 60 mg, 2x's/d for 11 yrs. and that doctor retired...no doctor would prescribe a full opiate agonist and that was 5yrs. ago.

"July 21, 2017",Panic Disorder,About a year ago I was diagnosed with severe anxiety with panic attacks. Anxiety runs in my family so for me it was not a huge shock for me to have anxiety. I have tried about three different medications that just made me feel awful. I did not feel like myself and I was always sleepy. Once I  got put on Xanax with another type of anxiety medication it helped subside my panic attacks. Anytime I would have a panic attack I would take a Xanax and it would help me be able to fell like myself again. I do not take Xanax every day just because I do not have panic attacks everyday and because it is highly addicted. For me this medication worked.,8.0

"July 11, 2017",Anxiety,"Xanax is like putting a band-aid over a wound that needs stitches. This med helped take the edge off my anxiety and am thankful for it. It will NOT treat GAD properly because you'll be dependent with too many doses, but is a godsend for panic disorders. I still struggle with anxiety (anger, headaches, worrying, crazy thoughts). It helped me be able to sleep, socialize, not have panic attacks at work, great sex drive and I feel calm. I was prescribed 0.5mg twice a day, usually took less otherwise I'd be sleeping all day, only could go about a day without it then I need it again for anxiety. The biggest downside is that it makes me REALLY tired, lazy, poor memory sometimes. When mixed with alcohol I get very angry. Will be looking into SSRIs.",8.0
"July 10, 2017",Anxiety,Xanax is a medication that must be taken seriously and with precaution. This is not a game. Taking it when you don't need to will only create addiction and the withdrawal is worse than living with the actual anxiety. Please don't take this med unless you suffer from anxiety and you are having a panic attack. It works well in these situations but my advice is to stay away from it and only take it in an emergency. I prefer lorazepam. When you take lorazepam the withdrawal symptoms are more tolerable than xanax. Xanax is awesome but it can become Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. You can die from this or get a DUI if you are caught in a driving accident. This is serious.,7.0

I noticed that overtime especially in the months I took it more often, the anxiety, the fast heart beats and confusion and strange muscle weakness were getting beyond tolerable.

It allows me to return back to my normal non-anxious self. I rarely have noticed sleepiness as an effect of the medication- only when I was already sleepy before taking it.

I couldn't sleep for 4 days straight-- I had to miss work,  I was threatening suicide in front of my family-- I was LOSING it. Couldn't keep anything down.

There was a time that I was having multiple panic attacks daily for months. Xanax helped me stay sane until my psychiatric found the right SSRI for me. I think that this drug is great as long as you have a good doctor and use the appropriate amount.,10
"January 10, 2017",Anxiety,"I suffer from emetophobia-related panic attacks and anxiety, and this drug is just a godsend. I try to reserve it until I really need it as I know that, based on my personality, I could pretty easily become dependent. If it wasn't for the issues with dependency and withdrawal it would be a ten out of ten for me.
I will note that after I stopped using it semi-regularly, I became better at dealing with anxiety ""on my own"" so to speak, and experienced less anxiety overall as I improved my coping skills. Still, I'm really grateful for this medication and encourage other miserably anxious people out there to discuss it with their doctors. It really improved my life when I thought nothing could.",9.0

Real xanax have a very distinct taste. and it never melted in my mouth. xanax always melt in my mouth within a few minutes. I've seen videos on youtube of people pressing them. My advice is.

These symptoms persisted until I stopped the medication. I tried it once or twice after stopping the first time, and the horrible symptoms came right back. I couldn't even do my work.

Im trying to get off them now myself but I am so very deep in a hole its almost hard to see the end. Once you stop say goodbye to sleep for a while and feeling like complete psychosis for the next few weeks or months till your brain comes back from the hole you dug for it. If I could go back and never take a benzo I would in a heart beat ssris and ssnris never worked for me.,10

"December 10, 2016",Anxiety,"Xanax does feel like a miracle drug, but then addictive drugs always do at 1st. All is fine, for someone with anxiety there definitely does seem to be some kind of euphoria, because you feel like you can properly have jokes, interact socially, be yourself again e.t.c. It's only a band-aid, I know it's not an ideal world where everyone can get the best therapies e.t.c. but in truth it doesn't work forever and many people (such as myself) end up with inter-dose withdrawals and 'psychological dependence', (""OMG I FORGOT TO PACK MY XANAX HOW WILL I COPE?""). Compared to the withdrawals I experienced (no seizures thank god), the anxiety that made me go to the doc in the 1st place was very minor. I would advise use for no more than a month.",3.0

I do believe that this has aborted a seizure too. I can't stand to get out in public, my heart races, I feel this sense of panic, and then think, ""What if I have another seizure in public?"". Feel much calmer on this medication.

But there were definitely signs of a building anxiety disorder before that. As opposed to normal anxiety, which we should all try to cope with as best as possible without unnecessary drugs. But these attacks had become all-day, distracting, genuinely life-disrupting experiences, tense muscles, constant intrusive thoughts, inability to concentrate on other things, etc. At that point, there's something wrong, and it needs to be diagnosed.

It helped so much and I was finally able to calm down enough to think clearly. I got on Zoloft and continued taking Xanax until my anxiety and depression was manageable. Now I only need it every once in a while when the anxiety and obsessive thoughts get bad. Definitely helped me get on my feet.",10

Coming off the xanax was the hardest thing I've ever done.  I had to force myself to work and keep my job. I had good days and bad days (more bad than good). My symptoms were crazy. No sleep, headaches, shakes, twitching, pain everywhere, memory problems. If I knew how hard it is to come off benzo's, I never would have touched it. Short term use= ok. Stressful event=ok. If this helps one person, then yay. Please be careful! Don't end up detoxing off of a benzo and going thru hell for weeks or months. Research this med. Not fun!",1.0

I bet that was an understatement. Because I keep getting slack about the medication I have tried kalanapin which brought me out like a teenager and did not work for me. I have tried valium which was way too strong for me. I have been on this medication for over 15 years and have never had to up my dosage not once and it still works. ",10

I take .25mg no more than twice a week and within 20 minutes I feel calm and relaxed. Combine it with yoga and meditation and all your worries are gone. I like to take a .25mg pill and immediately do some yoga and meditate for 20 minutes. By the time you're done meditating you'll feel great for a couple hours. It helps just knowing the pill is there if I want it. I actually find that I take it much less than twice a week, only 1 or 2 times a month if that. I have no other side effects that I notice.",9.0

I've only always took 1/2 of 0.25mg to take the edge off when I felt my anxiety coming on and if I knew I was going to do something out of my comfort zone! It has helped me tremendously. I concentrate better and it actually helps my stuttering. I'm a firefighter/paramedic and I'm constantly dealing with stressful situations! I love my job and never could have done it without Xanax. I hate that it gets a bad wrap because people abuse it! I have never even come close to abusing it and use it for what it's for! Throughout the years I've tried all other anti anxiety medications and Xanax is the only one that helped me! It's almost like I have a chemical imbalance and Xanax corrects it!,10

It is completely effective against all of my anxiety. It also makes me feel less OCD. I no longer obsess over thoughts or worry while I am on this. Xanax unleashes my creativity. I play guitar, write music and draw a lot. I used to do all these things but have thought I lost interest because I had no inspiration.

I have no side effects except some memory loss and tiredness.

I wish my doctor would up my prescription, I am on 2 mg a day and for the past nine months I have always finished my prescription in 1 - 2 weeks. But this does well for keeping tolerance low and avoiding addiction and dependence. I am on it for 2 weeks and then off until my refill.",10

"October 13, 2015",Anxiety,"I like to think of this as headache medicine. Take only when you have one. This medicine should be used in emergencies only. It is not for taking everyday. For that I recommend something that has a longer shelf-life-that takes longer to break down, like Klonopin. Because of Xanax short wait time and short shelf-life, it can make you feel like an addict. If you forget a dose, in less than 4 hrs you can experience WORSE symptoms of anxiety because they come without warning or provocation. Instant panic attacks, inability to think or work, etc. However, as a panic attack reducer or for the instant release of an intense anxiety-related event, I do highly recommend it.",8.0

I've tried yoga meditation and all natural remedies. I've come to terms with the fact it is genetic. I didn't know xanax existed. I've tried all antidepressants and they messed me up pretty bad.

I'm aware that there are some addictive problems for some people, happily after that one night of relaxation its like I was freed from a tormenting chamber and I didn't feel need for more.

My anxiety issues stem from a traumatic childhood making me miss out on a lot of GREAT opportunities throughout life, opportunities that Xanax is helping me take advantage of today. I am a very active male, I run and lift regularly and what I noticed about Xanax from the get go is that I had an extremely high tolerance to it.

I actually saw, for myself, how bad the memory problems can be. When I experienced that. I went to my Dr an said, I wanted ween myself off, but slowly, not stupid either.

In prison they will only give med's to people detoxing from alcohol or benzo's.  Bc it can kill you! Short term, stressful event like flying or giving a speech or a panic attack- will do you good.

He prescribed me xanax to use as a short term medication for my anxiety attacks as he said weed can cause horrible anxiety for a month in some ppl. I took it as prescribed which was every six hours as needed. I started with about .25mg a day but took .5 a few times when it was real bad. 2 weeks later I began splitting the pills in half to .12.

When I was 18 and was seeing a psychologist he diagnosed me as having agoraphobia, I'm guessing because they really didn't have the term ""social phobia/anxiety"" at that time. I finally started taking Paxil and it worked good for 10 yrs then I maxed out on dosage and it stopped working. Tried all the other SSRI's/SSNRI's. Effexor XR worked best but didn't help anxiety/or social phobia issues. Got on Klonopin, then Xanax eventually. Benzodiazepines are life savers for socialphobia.",10

Some doctors will tell you to take them everyday as prescribed, but I found in my 20 years of experience with Xanax that taking them everyday is an easy way for it to become habit forming and addictive. When I take them as needed I don't become dependent on them. I think doctors disagree with this method because they feel that you need to counter the anxiety before you get it and that way you can learn to tolerate it. I have tried using Xanax both ways, it's nice not having anxiety, but your body and mind will adapt to the dosage and if you take it long enough you will find you need a higher dose to feel like you did.",10

Some people are more sensitive than others. Generally, you take a pill (depends on dosage) and you just start feeling your tight chest and stomach release, and I notice I begin breathing more calmly and normally. Just feels good all over, which is such a contrast from the horrors of anxiety.

It can make you a little sleepy. I think for 'normal people' it would make them very sleepy. For 'anxious' people, I think it makes you normal and relaxed.

The one problem is that if you take it too much, like three days in a row, the effect is reduced and you have to 'up' the dosage. I think it works best for occasional use, like before a difficult situation or when you're just having a lot of anxiety and need calm.",10

My mind was racing and all I could think was these terrible thoughts.  I was prescribed 0.5 mg of Xanax and I cut the pills in half throughout the day. I have never had such a quick relief from panic attacks. I almost instantly feel normal when I take them. And it lasts for quite a while until I take the other half of the medication.

The problem now is that not 1 psychiatrist is willing to prescribe it to me.  They keep giving me Abilify, Prozac, Vistaril, and trazodone.

These days I don't need to use it continuously because just knowing that Xanax is there and works so well if I need it has a calming effect.

"February 27, 2012",Anxiety,"I've taken Xanax for years for occassional insomia. For the past year, I've been battling with high blood pressure along with some new health issues that popped up. For the last two weeks, my heart has been racing and my stomach has had butterflies.  I really felt like hiding under the covers and didn't know why. I kept wondering why am I SO afraid lying in bed watching TV?  I felt as though my heart was about to just rip itself out of my chest.  So I decided to take a Xanax during the day and it was like a miracle cure.  Hopefully, the panic attacks wont last forever, but thank God, I had something to help.",9.0
"February 19, 2012",Anxiety,Just great. I do not use the prescribed amount (0.5mg every 8 hours or every 4 hours as needed). I have not used for a week now but just took 1/2 pill and 25 minutes later I feel good.,10

"February 14, 2012",Panic Disorder,"Amazing. Helps so much with my panic attacks. It works almost instantly, which is just what I need. By the time Xanax kicks in, the worst of my panic attack has lessened. This medicine allows me to quickly nip the attack in the bud and allow me to function normally. It does taste terrible, but is worth it! Great medicine. Fast working and effective. What more could you ask for?",10
"February 12, 2012",Anxiety,"Xanax has literally saved my life. I also suffer of mitral valve prolapse and I had mvp symptoms when stressed or when my panic attacks and anxiety would kick in. Xanax took care of all my symptoms, it even kept my spiking blood pressure in check. What a miracle medication, thank you from my heart to whoever found it.",NaN
"February 2, 2012",Anxiety,"I am so thankful for this medication! It has saved me countless trips to the ER due to severe, gripping panic attacks. It took about 8 years of anxiety, useless ""trying"" of several SSRI's, and DOZENS of trips to the hospital hyperventilating, shaking, screaming with my pulse approaching 200 before a smart doctor finally prescribed Me Xanax. 
I take the medication on an as-needed basis, and sparingly.
I take 0.25mg (half pill) to prevent anxiety attacks when anticipating an panic-inducing situation. I take 0.50mg at the first signs an attack is starting. The quickest, most effective route is to lightly crush the pill with your teeth and let it dissolve beneath your tongue. 
My experience with Xanax is pretty much identical to that of Ativan.",9.0
"February 2, 2012",Anxiety,"Since developing Pneumonia back in September I have been experiencing very bad panic attacks (never had them before the pneumonia). I didnt know what panic attacks even were so I spent countless days in the hospital really feeling like I was dying. I believe the panic attacks is masking another condition that the doctors have yet to find, which also means the Xanax is just masking something not treating it at all. But I have to live with taking them because nothing else helps.",NaN

"January 6, 2012",Anxiety,"Xanax has been a life saver. I have always had problems feeling a little anxious.  But once I was diagnosed as having a brain tumor at 26, it only made things worse.  My doctor prescribed Lexapro, which worked okay, but I didn't like the way it made me feel, so I stopped taking them on my own.  One particular night about 3 weeks ago, I got so upset that I thought I was having a heart attack.  I was dizzy, chest hurting and pounding, weakness. Nobody could find anything medically wrong with me.  I asked the doctor for something for anxiety to which he prescribed Xanax 0.25mg every 6 hours and within the 30 minutes of taking it, all my symptoms had diminished.  Xanax really saved my life.",10

My heart is racing, I am terrified and I feel like I will go crazy before it stops.  They are so scary because no matter how many times I have suffered through them, I am always sure I am dying when I have one.  Previously I was given other medications like Buspar or Paxil, but I didn't tolerate them very well and they did not stop the attacks - only slowed them down.  Once I was prescribed Xanax I noticed that the medication would actually stop a panic attack in its tracks, which was a miracle.  The medication has almost completely stopped the attacks - but not 100 %.",9.0

I have only had 2 panic attacks in the last 6 months. I can sleep all night without waking up, I am much more laid back, I am calm and not worrying all the time. I would definitely talk to your MD about both of these medicines if you truly have an Anxiety disorder.  Both have been a life saver for me and my family.",10
"December 30, 2011",Panic Disorder,"I have had horrible panic attacks out of nowhere since I was in elementary school. I got on Xanax when I was 13 years old, and still take it today.

I was crying all the time, was hyperventilating, had bouts of my heart fluttering and many other typical ""anxiety-related"" symptoms. I was at the point that I was afraid I was dying or going crazy. Over the years, my dosage has been adjusted to work with my life at the time, but I have always taken it exactly as prescribed and have never wanted or needed more than was prescribed.  As a matter of fact, I am currently taking 0.5 mg two times per day, but can take as much as 1 mg five times per day.",10
"December 27, 2011",Anxiety,Works great for short notices. If you find yourself in a anxiety situation or short notice to do some public speaking then Xanax is great for those situations.  When I take them I only take half the pill and that dose is fine for me. It kicks in about 20-30 minutes and lasts a good couple of hours at the most. Its similar to Klonopin but works faster. I recommend it for as needed use only. If its an all day thing then Klonopin is better. Just my experience with it. Others may vary.,9.0
"December 16, 2011",Anxiety,"This works great for me too, with little to no side effects. But the doctors say it is addictive. I HAVEN'T NOTICED. Been on it for over a year I take as needed.

I have tried every antidepressant medicine under the sun, some were mildly effective but the side effects were worse than the depression. I went to a new doctor and he asked if I have ever tried Xanax. I said no I thought that was used for anxiety. He prescribed me 1.5 mg a day I started noticing a difference the first day. This stuff is amazing been on it for 2 months finally some relief. Its unfortunate its abused so much and so hard to get a doctor to prescribe it. I haven't had any side effects, I have such a positive outlook on everything now. It has completely changed my life for the better. All the symptoms that come along with depression I had are gone.",10

"December 11, 2011",Anxiety,"I suffer from generalized anxiety disorder, so Xanax has served as my ""safety net"" in times of distress. When taken as prescribed, those of us who need it simply feel like life is bearable again. Those nagging irrational thought patterns and worries are silenced.

However, Xanax is not a medicine to be taken lightly (hence the bad reputation it's received). It's short half-life causes cravings to re-dose (vs Klonopin, which never gives me those feelings). Use in moderation, and make an effort to see a cognitive-behavioral therapist if you haven't done so.",10
"December 11, 2011",Panic Disorder,"This treatment completely stopped my panic attacks which I thought could never be controlled. Just take 1 when you get up to guarantee a peaceful day. I tried all the antidepressants, from Depakote to lithium they all had some weird side effect. ",10

I am on Celexa and had to add Xanax to my regimen a year ago after having my first panic attack. I take 0.25mg as needed and sometimes before bed to help me sleep. Xanax has helped me calm my nerves and relax. Usually within the first half hour, I feel like I can chill out.

I noticed that when I stopped taking it that I could not sleep for days and I became shaky at times, and the anxiety returns immediately. The other thing that I notice is that after a while you become immune to the dosage. If you only take it with the onset of an anxiety or panic attack it shouldn't be a problem.",8.0
"November 25, 2011",Depression,Xanax is so great for me because I self-injure. It gives me the rational stance in my head when I feel like cutting myself. It doesn't allow me the energy to get so angry at myself. You just have to remember to actually take it when you feel your attack coming on and have patience for it to kick in. This is the best benzodiazepine because it works the fastest. Ativan is good sometimes. I saw trails but Xanax being the fastest but Klonopin lasts the longest.,9.0

I am still taking Xanax under GP supervision, as it helps relieve the level of anxiety tremendously.  It is the best medication ever made for people who are born prone to anxiety throughout their childhood/adolescence and extreme shyness, yes shyness.

Well, when I first tried it, it was an immediate success and I knew I found the key to living the rest of my life normally. My doctor didn't just throw this at me. This was our last option. It was the best one.

I do get dizzy sometimes. I also experienced weight gain. That was mainly because as I started to live normally again I stopped working out and other methods that I used to help combat panic. That was mainly a healthier life style that I assumed would naturally help me think clear.",10

I finally settled down with my now soon to be husband, and with the persuasion of him and my father (now sober, and also has anxiety) At age 18 I finally broke down and decided to go talk to a doctor. He prescribed me to multiple anti-depressants that made everything worse. He then put me on Xanax, I've never been so stress free.

And after trying all of these different medications, I didn't think I EVER could get rid of the depression and anxiety and live a normal life (which in turn made me even more depressed), but then in comes Xanax! And it didn't take long before I was almost entirely free from both the depression and the anxiety, which had had such a strong grip on my life for such a long time and almost ruined my life!

I have taken up to 12 mg/day but I find that 4-6 mg/day is best. Side effects are non-existent nor have I ever experienced any form of withdrawal.

I got from the place of not being able to walk outside or answer the phone to being able to get married, have a job, go on vacations. Anything I wanted to do. I WAS NORMAL.  But now I'm 36 and on the highest dose 4 mg a day and about 4 1/2 years ago my horrible anxiety came back even though I'm taking it.  I can't work, drive or really go anywhere anymore.

It has been over a month now and I am slowly coming off of the Xanax. I am down to about 1mg every 2 days or so and I haven't had any additional medications.

After going on Xanax, I felt so much better and relieved. I try not to take Xanax everyday, as it is not meant to be a long-term solution to anxiety and can be very addicting, so be very careful.

Of course they should not start on the dosage I take but at least get them started and take it from there.... The antidepressant's JUST DON'T DO IT FOR ME.

I'm currently in the phase of trying to find a more ""regular"" medication to control my anxiety/OCD (currently trying venlafaxine), as the Xanax isn't meant to be a daily thing.

My Doctor finally prescribed Xanax after a horrible episode of just trying to drive home from his office. I had to stop about 20 times because I was crying so bad. He said I was suffering from PTSD. Without Xanax I do not think I would have been able to handle all the legal paperwork that I had to do, plus work. Now in 2010 we had to close our business and have lost my job.

I ended up breaking most of the pills in half and only taking 0.5 mg usually 3x a day, and find it relieves my anxiety without the level of sleepiness a whole mg gives me. I usually only take a whole pill if I feel a panic attack coming on.

My doctor tried other benzo's but they just did not help the sudden attacks. They have upped my dose.
But at this point Xanax is a life saver and I don't know what I would do without them.

I have energy again, I'm not so tense, snappy or experiencing the extreme anxiety that would peak at around 2pm. I'm careful to take as I need, and while doctors may not like prescribing it, the truth is many of us will be on medication forever. I've found something that doesn't feel like medication, I just feel like me.",10

Yes it doesnot last long in your body but with the Paxil and Xanax together I no longer need to call 911 to go to the ER. Only once did I within the last 6 months due to finding out my best friend in the whole world my dad, has cancer... but as long as this medicine is not abused it works great. With the help of my therapist and psych doctor I hope someday I can go outside but I am still afraid due to the bad panic disorder I have.",10

I do take more for long flights where I spend 12 to 24 hours inside the airline system. I started on .25 Mg daily and 10 years later still use the same amount. If I miss a dose more than a day, I get antsy, then clammy skin and finally unjustified panic attack on 3rd or 4th day. This is well expected and acceptable response to quitting abruptly.

At first 1mg three times a day was great Ii could work, go into social settings and even to stores. It gradually got up to 2mgs 3 times a day for about 5 years then came the beginning of the end. I had began using more and more of this wonder drug and I ran out horrible withdrawal symptoms beginning with night sweats, not sleeping confusion and finally seizures not to mention the mental twists and games my mind played on me.

Get over my fears and make an enormous amount of friends in my life. Although the only problem is that my doctor now tells me after 18 months of taking this dose that he thinks the Depakote (1000mg) a day is helping me and that he is going to start taking me off the benzodiazapines. I tried to see if I would be able to get off of them and live normally, I found myself worse than before the medication with severe withdrawal symptoms. ",10

They fight each other for ""bars"" and pay a fortune for them. The family is a complete wreck. family members had forgotten important things, like family matters, misplacing wallets, purses etc... even getting into car accidents while they're on them.

Xanax was like a miracle pill for me. I got some felt so relieved, a little dizzy at first but relieved that I wasn't so panicky any more I'm guessing you should only take it when you start feeling like your going to get a panic attack again or as told by your doctor. Just don't drink any alcohol while you're on Xanax. It does make me feel sleepy but sometimes when I feel like going out I fight it and I don't sleep and I'm still able to go out and enjoy myself.",9.0

I called them ""my darling little Easter eggs,"" they were so precious in relieving the terror that developed into agoraphobia. At max dose I was so sedated I started calling it ""Zombinal."" It had stopped working its magic, and under the care of a naturopath I simply stopped taking it. Amazingly, after a couple of shaky days, my anxiety diminished and panic attacks were history. I later learned that between depleted receptors and mini-withdrawls, Xanax was actually causing my symptoms. No more Xanax, no more panic, not even the slightest anxiety. I guess I got cured.",6.0

I was awake for 3 days but I did it. I know now that I needed to reduce it a little at a time because I had been taking a high dose for a while. It's a life saver for bad anxiety, just watch the dosage and be careful about how long you are taking it. If you keep those 2 things in mind it's the best anti-anxiety medicine.",10

I know it's addictive but since most of my anxiety is genetic related I feel I must stay on it. ,10

However, through prolonged use of this medication I have as a result become addicted, as when I do not receive my scheduled dose I feel withdrawals.

A few minutes later I was completely paralyzed, crippled and numb.  I had my boyfriend call 911 and they took me to the ER.

"November 12, 2008",Panic Disorder,"I didn't realize all the stress that I had been under. I'd actually experienced a panic attack for the first time at 23 while I was driving home from college.  I thought that I was going to die.  I was frightened by the entire experience.  I went to my doctor who prescribed me with the lowest dose of Xanax in addition to 20mg Prozac.  About three months later my doctor decided to increase my Prozac to 30mg.  I haven't needed Xanax for months, but I keep it on me where ever I go.  Xanax is so fast acting.  It calms my nerves instantly.",10
"October 29, 2008",Panic Disorder,I have suffered from severe panic attacks for 15 years. Xanax is the ONLY medicine that has helped me. I don't take it 3 times daily as prescribed. I take it only when I have a panic attack. It works wonders!,10
"October 21, 2008",Depression,"I have severe depression and general anxiety disorder.  I take 100mg/day of Zoloft, and that pretty well takes care of my depression, and most of my panic attacks.  Occasionally, I'll take 0.25mg for a panic attack, but I'm cautious because sometimes the downside of coming off a panic attack sends me into a fit of depression.  I highly recommend both Zoloft and Xanax, I just want to put the word out there to use good judgement when treating a panic attack when you have depression as well.",8.0
"October 21, 2008",Anxiety,There is not a better drug than xanax for my anxiety.  I love it!  Thanks to this drug I can do simple things like go to my kids schools with out going into a panic attack!,10

"October 1, 2008",Panic Disorder,"I have used Xanax since 1996. I love it. It has saved my life so many times, I can't count. I have gone through different times in my life, where I had to take 9mgs a day just to survive the panic attacks. My attacks come in cycles. I have had them since 7 years old and I am now 39. I am so tired of them and feeling them. I had a big one today as a matter of fact. I am going through withdrawl of getting off of Lexapro. I am never without my Xanax though. Simply carrying it around helps keep off the panic attacks sometimes. If I hadn't had it, I would have been put away or had killed myself long ago, because having panic attacks is no way to live.",10

"April 6, 2008",Panic Disorder,"Efficacy never in doubt with this fast acting benzodiazapine. Alprazolam works on the neuro-transmitter GABA to induce calming effects. It is useful to many patients who try it and is preferred over similar medications because of its relative safety. Regardless of how it is used, it is very potent and may be habit forming. A typical dose for a recreational user or someone addicted to this drug may be many times what would be considered safe. If taking Xanax more than 4 mg per day then slowly taper.",7.0
